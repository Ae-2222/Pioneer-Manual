# Flying your ship

Your ship is equipped with a computerised flight and navigation
control system, as well as a complete suite of communications
systems. Conventional input methods are used; a keyboard, a
pointing device and (if the pilot has the necessary implants) a
neural interface.

## The heads-up display

Your ship's main display, which is a transparent panel mounted
across your front viewport (or, in an armoured vessel, whichever
wall or bulkhead is in front of you). Normally, it allows you to
see whatever is on teh other side of the viewport, but is capable
of rendering any image, or augmenting the outside view, anywher eon
its surface. Thus, what appears to be the "windshield" of your
starship doubles up as an extremely capable HUD, communications
output device and entertainment centre.

It is not recommended that you use this display to show holovids or
other distracting material whilst in control of the vessel.

## The console

Your ship comes with the very latest in dynamic console technology.
The images on the various control panels change with their
function, which change depending on the context. It is seamlessly
integrated with the heads-up display, and both your pointing device
and neural interface can be used to interact with it.

The console contains the following features:



-   The left hand panel:
    -   The clock, showing the current time and date
    -   The Stardreamer time compression device
    -   Four buttons: View control, Navigation, Information,
        Communication

-   The central panel, a multi-purpose display containing any of:
    -   Scanner
    -   Speed, ambient pressure and altitude indicators
    -   Missiles, ECM and other equipment controls
    -   Incoming messages

-   The right hand panel:
    -   Mode selector for the central panel
    -   Current condition indicators
    -   Four buttons: Engine control, Undercarriage, Hyperspace, HUD
        labels


The four buttons on the left hand side of the panel always perform
the same functions.

The view control button will switch from any view on the main
display to a view of space, and if pressed repeatedly will switch
between the fron t view (by turning transparent, or using the front
camera), the rear view, and a simulated external view, interpolated
by camera information, sensor information and a computer-generated
representation of your ship. The button's appearance will change to
reflect which view is active, or if the display isn't showing an
outside view, which one will become active when you press it:


<table>
<tr><td><img src="images/cam_front.png" alt="Forward camera/window" width=30 height=22 /></td><td>Forward camera/window</td><tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/cam_front_on.png" alt="Forward camera/window (active)" width=30 height=22 /></td><td>Forward camera/window (active)</td><tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/cam_rear.png" alt="Rear camera" width=30 height=22 /></td><td>Rear camera</td><tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/cam_rear_on.png" alt="Rear camera (active)" width=30 height=22 /></td><td>Rear camera (active)</td><tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/cam_external.png" alt="Simulated external view" width=30 height=22 /></td><td>Simulated external view</td><tr>
<tr><td><img src="images/cam_external_on.png" alt="Simulated external view (active)" width=30 height=22 /></td><td>Simulated external view (active)"</td><tr>
</table>
### Keyboard shortcuts

If your neural interface or pointing device aren't connected, the
keyboard provides access to many of the console functions.



-   The stardreamer can be controlled using **Shift-F1** to
    **Shift-F5**
-   The buttons on the left panel can be controlled using **F1** to
    **F4**
-   The buttons on the right panel can be controlled using **F5**
    to **F8**

## Taking off

Your ship's automated systems make such old-fashioned practices as
lengthy pre-flight checks unnecessary. If the ship is in any way
unready for flight, the shipboard computer will inform you of this
fact. One common reason why a ship will refuse to launch is that it
does not have the minimum number of crew on board. This isn't a
problem with a small, one-man ship.

If your ship is landed at a surface starport, or in an orbital
spaceport, taking off is as simple as requesting launch clearance
from the station's interface. To do this, click the communications
icon on the left hand side of the ship console, or press F4, then
select the first option on the menu. The launch elevator will
remove your ship from the port, and your ship will automatically
make a small thrust maneouvre away from the entrance.

If the port is an "open-air" port (one not equipped with an
elevator, where your ship remains on a planet's surface), you will
have to launch the ship yourself after requesting clearance. This
is achieved by clicking the launch icon on the right hand side of
the console, or pressing F5.

When you take off, your ship will be under manual control. When
taking off from a planet, this means that you must take more or
less immediate action to avoid falling back to the ground.

## Control

There are two ways in which you can actively control your ship. The
first of these, "Manual control," gives you the most control, and
requires the pilot to use a larger number of controls. The second,
"Set speed," reduces the number of controls but gives a slightly
reduced level of control, by having the shipboard computer take
over the job of firing individual thrusters. These modes are
switched using the engine control icon, or the F5 key, when in
flight.

Manual control requires the use of twelve keys, with the option of
also using the mouse.

*Attitude:*

-   **Q** and **E** roll your ship left and right.
-   **A** and **D** yaw your ship left and right.
-   **W** and **S** pitch your ship up and down.
-   When holding the right hand button on the pointing device, it
    controls yaw and pitch.

*Thrust:*

-   **I** engages the main, rear thruster. This is the most
    powerful one.
-   **K** engages the front, retro thruster.
-   **J** engages the right thruster, pushing the ship left.
-   **L** engages the left thruster, pushing the ship right.
-   **U** engages the ventral thruster, pushing the ship up.
-   **O** engages the dorsal thruster, pushing the ship down.

In set speed mode, the thrust keys become inactive. Instead, the
speed of the ship is set by the computer, relative to the nearest
significant astrometric body (such as a space station, planet or
star).

-   The initial set speed is the magnitude of your velocity when
    the computer takes over. This means: it's the same speed, but if
    your ship isn't going forwards, it soon will be.
-   The speed can be set to a higher amount with the **Return**
    key.
-   The speed can be set to a lower speed with the **Right Shift**
    key.
