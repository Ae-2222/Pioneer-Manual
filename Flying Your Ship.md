# Flying your ship
## Taking off
Your ship's automated systems make such old-fashioned practices as lengthy pre-flight checks unnecessary.  If the ship is in any way unready for flight, the shipboard computer will inform you of this fact.

If your ship is landed at a surface starport, or in an orbital spaceport, taking off is as simple as requesting launch clearance from the station's interface.  To do this, click the communications icon on the left hand side of the ship console, or press F4, then select the first option on the menu.  The launch elevator will remove your ship from the port, and your ship will automatically make a small thrust maneouvre away from the entrance.

If the port is an "open-air" port (one not equipped with an elevator, where your ship remains on a planet's surface), you will have to launch the ship yourself after requesting clearance.  This is achieved by clicking the launch icon on the right hand side of the console, or pressing F5.
