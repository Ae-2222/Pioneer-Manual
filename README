This is the development repository for Pioneer Space Sim's wiki.  The files
here are the markdown files for a GitHub wiki.  Periodic releases from this
development repository will be pushed into the real wiki on GitHub.

This wiki's purpose is to be the official game manual for the Pioneer space
sim.  As such, we are looking for content which can be made suitable for
export to a document format, or even for print.

If you wish to contribute to Pioneer's manual, please feel free to clone
this repository.  Brian Ronald is the maintainer ("merge monkey").  Please
feel free to contact him with any questions.

The manual's markdown files are generated from the HTML files in the html
subdirectory.  Any changes to content should be made to the HTML files.
