This is the development repository for Pioneer Space Sim's manual.  The files
here are the markdown files which will be made available in this project's own
wiki.

This wiki's purpose is to be the official game manual for the Pioneer space
sim.  As such, we are looking for content which can be made suitable for
export to a document format, or even for print.

If you wish to contribute to Pioneer's manual, please feel free to clone
this repository.  Brian Ronald is the maintainer ("merge monkey").  Please
feel free to contact him with any questions.
